# One Piece Episode Ratings and Viewer Activity Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the ratings and reviewer activity of the *One Piece* anime series using publicly available data from IMDb. It explores how episode ratings fluctuate over time, examines viewer engagement, and highlights differences between canon and filler content. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and trends in both the qualitative reception (ratings) and quantitative engagement (reviewer activity) across various arcs and sagas of the series.

## Overview

*One Piece*, one of the longest-running and most beloved anime series, has been on the air for over two decades. With its ever-growing number of episodes, tracking fan sentiment and engagement throughout its massive run offers fascinating insights into the series’ reception. By analyzing episode ratings and the number of reviewer votes over time, this project uncovers how different arcs, sagas, and individual episodes have been perceived by viewers.

The project involves:
- Rating fluctuations over time, segmented by canon and filler episodes.
- Exploring the relationship between ratings and total number of reviewer votes.
- A deep dive into viewer engagement based on story sagas and arcs.
- Comparing episodes across various levels of viewer interaction, narrative structure, and content type (canon vs. filler).

## Key Insights

- **Overall Ratings**: Ratings remain relatively consistent throughout the series (around 7-8/10). However, significant fluctuations occur around key events or arcs, such as Marineford, Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and Wano.
- **Canon vs. Filler**: Canon episodes generally receive higher ratings than filler episodes. Filler episodes tend to show slightly lower reviewer activity and ratings, but not as dramatically as one might expect.
- **Reviewer Activity**: Early episodes, especially from the East Blue and Alabasta arcs, see significantly more engagement than later episodes. The series’ fanbase seems to slow down after the time skip but picks up again for more recent arcs like Wano.
- **Saga and Arc Analysis**: Longer and more developed arcs like Ennies Lobby, Marineford, and Dressrosa tend to receive higher ratings, while shorter, less developed arcs like Fishman Island and Punk Hazard perform worse. Notably, the *One Piece* community shows less activity around specific filler arcs, with some arcs seeing higher ratings despite fewer votes.
- **Climactic Moments**: Large spikes in both ratings and votes often correlate with climactic events, such as major battles and turning points in the story.
