    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece* is one of the most successful media franchises to come out of Japan. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with rubber abilities and a signature straw hat, who sets out on a journey to find the legendary treasure \"One Piece\" and to become the King of the Pirates. This simple premise has kept fans of the series hooked and eagerly awaiting a conclusion for nearly three decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One Piece Vol. 1 and Vol.61 manga covers](https://b1328696.smushcdn.com/1328696/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/01-61.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First published in 1997 as a manga in *Weekly Shonen Jump*, *One Piece* has captivated readers worldwide with its rich storytelling and colorful characters. Toei Animation's anime adaptation began airing in 1999, bringing the epic odyssey to television screens across Japan. Over time, the \"One Piece\" franchise has become a global sensation. An early English dub was handled by 4Kids Entertainment during the mid-00s, but this version faced criticism for heavy censorship and narrative re-writes. Funimation acquired the English localization rights in 2007, and began producing a more faithful English version; this is the version that would go on to air on Toonami, Crunchyroll, and Netflix for most of series's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2025, the *One Piece* manga is [the best-selling manga in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga#At_least_100_million_copies_and_above), and has even surpassed the sales of other international comic books series, also making it [the best-selling comic book in history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_comic_series#Collected_comic_book_volumes) The television show has firmly cemented its influence among other top anime series, such as *Dragon Ball* and *Pokémon*. As the show approaches its final story arcs, it has experienced a renewed surge in popularity. Additionally, the release of *One Piece*'s live-action Netflix adaptation and the announcement of a future remake under Wit Studio (of *Attack on Titan* acclaim) further sparked mainstream interest, introducing the franchise to new audiences and reigniting enthusiasm among existing fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data visualization project intends to explore the *One Piece* anime throughout its production history and various story arcs. It will focus on the anime, but will briefly use some pre-included manga data to generate some insights concerning the anime. We will be using a combination of Jupyter Notebooks and Plotly for Python to create dynamic, information-rich charts. Plotly's interactive capabilities make it great choice for others to easily explore a dataset. This Jupyter notebook uses direct HTML links to copies of the data sources featured on my GitHub page, and only require common package installations like Pandas and BeautifulSoup to run on your own machine. However, for users who lack the ability to use Python and/or the relevant packages, I've included a version on Kaggle that it runnable without any coding knowledge needed whatsoever."

We will also be scraping updated television release dates and English-translated titles from an [online source](https://listfist.com/list-of-one-piece-anime-episodes); a copy of this scraped data is also hosted on my GitHub, in the event the web page and/or data becomes inaccessible.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"*As filler exists mostly for logistical reasons (e.g. preventing the anime from overtaking the manga), it cannot tangibly affect the canonical storyline. However, because the anime also presents itself as a single, serialized story, most filler tries to reconcile with canon events instead of overwriting them.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Filler material in the anime can exist in a number of different formats:\n",
    "- Manga cover page stories which were expanded upon to create full episodes (e.g. the \"Buggy Side Story Arc\" and the \"Koby and Helmeppo\" training arc).\n",
    "- Single-episode stories completely original to the anime (e.g. the Luffy/Zoro/Sanji one-shots that occur during the post-Ennies Lobby arc).\n",
    "- Entire (shorter) anime-original story arcs that occur between major canon story arcs (e.g. the \"G-8\" and \"Ice Hunter\" arcs).\n",
    "- Short ~4-episode filler arcs that act as promotional tie-ins to *One Piece* movie releases (e.g. the \"Little East Blue\" and \"Z's Ambition\" filler arcs).\n",
    "- \"Recap episodes\" that predominantly re-show and re-tell past anime events while contributing little-or-no new canonical material (episodes 279-283 are almost entirely character-focused recaps; this divides parts 1 and 2 of Ennies Lobby).\n",

    "##### The \"Saga\" column\n",
    "I mentioned earlier that this series is not easily broken down into explicit \"seasons\", as the show has been undergoing weekly development and release schedules year-round for 25 years up until recently (the animation received a three month break between 2024 and 2025). We were able to break everything down into story arcs, but this grouping is still not perfect. There are around 50 different story arcs in the anime, many of which are only 3-4 episodes long. These co-exist which larger story arcs that can be dozens or even hundreds of episodes (the final length of the Wano arc is just over 200 episodes!). Generally, later story arcs tend to last much, much longer than the earlier ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the series has been going on for so long, breaking down all the episodes into its story arcs doesn't work as well as most other shorter-running series. It's noticeable that the number of arcs builds up over time. However, there are still large narrative chunks of the story that strongly pertain to one another in large groupings. \"East Blue\" effectively acts as the introduction and prologue to the rest of the series. \"Ennies Lobby\" is often seen as the second half to \"Water Seven\". Similar relationships exists between \"Impel Down\" and \"Marineford\", along with other arts of the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toei Animation also takes note of this, and has also grouped and marketed cohesive sections of the series into larger collections. Instead of seasonal releases, multiple story arcs and various one-shots have been grouped and marketed as larger box sets, affectionately dubbed [\"Eternal Logs\"](https://store.toei-anim.co.jp/shop/g/gEYXA-13885-7) in reference to an item from the show. [We'll use these collections as our grouping criteria for tying together related story arcs](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Home_Video_Releases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some collections (\"Dressrosa\", \"Whole Cake Island\", and \"Wano\") are large enough that their Eternal Log sets have been further split into multiple parts. We're going to keep these parts grouped together. I'm also going to alias these larger groupings of story arcs as \"sagas\" in tradition with the first collection, the \"East Blue Saga\". There is some disagreement and ambiguity as to which arcs pertain to which sagas, which is I why I'm relying on the Eternal Log releases as a guide (so, although one could argue that \"Punk Hazard should be included with Dressrosa\", or \"Sabaody should be grouped with the rest of the 'Summit War' arcs\", I'm not relying on those groupings here). So, to recap:\n",

For instance, the first half of episode 61 contains concluding material from the \"Warship Island\" filler arc, while the latter half contains the Straw Hats entering the Grand Line via Reverse Mountain, an important canon event; I've leaned towards re-labeling this episode as 'canon'.  Further explanations are listed in the comments below.\n",

I want to present supplementary data about specific episodes when appropriate (including their name, number, arc, saga, etc.). The hover formatting options available with Plotly's `go` extension will enable this data to be presented in a much neater, more-organized format. The `go` extension will also aid in adding further plot features later on.\n",

We will organize a series of line segments to be plotted, based on episode ranges that belong to consecutive \"Function\" categorical values.\n",

Finally, we assign a `1` to the 'color' column for all rows, which will be used to modify the color reference in `px.colors.qualitative.Prism[1]` when we create our line plot."

    "What we've essentially created is a timeline of the *One Piece* anime series that is absolutely packed with information to explore. We can see how overall ratings remain relatively consistent throughout the show's history, fluctuating around an 8 out of 10. There is a steady growth in ratings as the story develops during Ennies Lobby, Marineford, Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and Wano. We also see substantial dips in ratings during the Fishman Island and Punk Hazard arcs, as well as most \"post-arc\" time spans where an abundance of filler content is released (notice the orange segments which follow the conclusions of major story arcs like Alabasta, Skypeia, and Ennies Lobby).\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing on this point, the distinction in average ratings between filler and non-filler material is more transparent in this visual. One can observe sharp downward spikes at any point in the story where filler material is inserted. Particularly notable is the section of anime episodes 196-226, which is 30 straight episodes of almost exclusively filler content. The only canon material in this stretch is half* of the Long Ring Long Land arc, which itself is sometimes treated as a very filler-ish canon arc (* 3 out of the 6 competitions in this arc are anime-only). There are also numerous points where filler content is inserted throughout the Ennies Lobby arc. As an aside, in my opinion, these light-hearted filler episodes are very jarring when they're dropped in the middle of the more climactic and serious story points during Ennies Lobby; this is likely why there is so much fluctuation in ratings between episodes 278 and 325.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many exciting and memorable moments throughout the series, and naturally, they often represent some of the highest peaks in episode ratings. Only some of these climactic moments have been marked by annotations, so it's worth exploring the interactive viewer to see more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do start to see increased wave height in the ratings fluctuations occurring towards the tail of the graph, from around episode 800 onwards. I'm curious to know what exactly is the cause of this, as only a small number of these peaks and dips are represented by climax and filler episodes respectively. Many of the later seasons are much longer, and some storyline components that occur during them can sometimes be criticized for \"dragging on\"; it's possible that these fluctuations could be related to the perceived pacing of the story. Other potential reasons could be the boost in Western interest in the show toward the end of the 2010s, or the increased movement of fan bases towards established social media sites in the 2010s. Changes in mainstream popularity, or fan shifts to [algorithm-driven platforms](https://medium.com/the-guild-association/hacking-the-hive-mind-af0601ca3206) could potentially drive [\"hive-minded\" tendencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1fkatpj/reddits_hive_mind_mentality_how_it_brings_out_the/) within a given community."

    "Continuing from ratings over time, let's now take a look at how the number of user votes change. Instead of release date, I'm going to organize this next chart by episode number. This shows an important quirk in the standardized nature of the series: there is nearly no extensive deviation in Toei Animation's weekly release schedule for the past 25 years. [Only recently did the anime undergo the first extended hiatus in its history](https://gamerant.com/one-piece-why-anime-hiatus-explained/), a break lasting six months in length. Up until now, the series has maintained an impressive production schedule of releasing one episode per week, every week, for as long as it has been undergoing production. If one looks closely at the previous timeline, they might notice a few occurrences of one week being skipped, or another week having a bonus episode release; for the most part the one-episode-per-week tradition is consistent, meaning that the episode numbers have a highly synched relation with release dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to again color this next plot based on the presence of canon and filler episodes within the series. Luckily, we can re-use the same line segment dataframe from earlier, and *also* the structure of the Plotly code used in the time series plot. Essentially, we only need to adjust our X and Y references, and any relevant titles and axis labels. The annotations are going to be re-customized for the chart, as their positions will need to shifted slightly. We won't be using a LOESS trend line in this plot, as there isn't really a need for it."

We mostly only notice spikes in user activity around memorable or climactic moments in the story. We don't see the same dips for filler episodes as we saw in the ratings chart, though it does seem like voter levels of filler gaps may be *marginally* lower than those of surrounding episodes (like a *micro*-decrease).\n",

Generally, it does seem that earlier episodes from before around episode ~130 tend to have more voter activity on average; particularly, the earlier the episode gets past this point, the higher the level. I would guess that a lot of this elevated activity is nostalgia and/or early viewers who either stop watching or stop reviewing later episodes. It should be noted that both [4Kids](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-12-06/4kids-cancels-one-piece-production) and [Toonami](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-29/cartoon-network-has-no-plans-for-one-piece-return) stopped or halted English localizations of the series between the Alabasta arc and Skypeia arcs, before Funimation later resumed work on their dubs in 2011. (If you were a 2007 American viewer like me, you might remember them climbing this waterfall-thing to enter Skypeia, and never getting to see the rest. Sooo, that's why.)\n",

We also start to see far more upwards spikes in voter levels towards the end of the chart; this is likely related to the large ratings fluctuations which we observed in the previous charts."

Most episodes seem to float around the median line, which itself has a log-like quality about it. The high-rating, high-vote scatter points seen toward the right side of the chart represent many of the instances in the large upwards spikes that existed in the prior two line charts.\n",

There are no episodes which constitute low-ratings and high number of user votes. This is good, as this would be an indicator of massive fan outrage (for comparison, the universally-panned [final season of Game of Thrones](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/game-of-thrones-ratings-26649/#votes) is a low-rated, high-voter scenario on the same website).The ratings division between filler and canon content is again observable here, as most of the lower-rated episodes constitute filler material."

    "What we can pull from this graph is that most *canon* story arcs in the series have between 30 and 50 episodes, especially after the first two seasons. The reasoning for the growth of episode counts per story arc is in-part due to the mangaka, and in-part due to production timelines. Oda has been known to let his imagination run wild when planning the series, resulting in writing style where later chapters of the manga often use more extensive storytelling formats compared to earlier sections. [One well-known example is where Oda's editors pushed him to condense two separate storylines into a single, condensed arc now known as Punk Hazard](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/4u03ab/oda_combining_arcs/) (which is why the island is bisected into two hot and cold areas). The growing number of anime episodes per story arc can also be attributed to [shifting chapter-to-episode ratio of the series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prOeb5wnNEk&t=18540s&ab_channel=AxelBeats%21?t=5h8m50s), which has typically been used to maintain the gap in production timelines between the manga and the anime.\n",

    "Among the longest story sagas are Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island, with the respective *arcs* the represent also making up the largest individual arcs. (* It should be noted that the Wano saga and arc(s) *would* be the longest sections if the data were up to date, but alas 🤷.) On the other hand, Punk Hazard, Fishman Island, and East Blue are the shortest story sagas. The shortest individual arcs typically around 2 episodes long, and are mostly composed of filler material (except for the Reverse Mountain arc)."

    "Many of the overall trends present in the earlier \"ratings over time\" line graph find themselves reiterated here. The show sees a moderate climb in ratings up until the \"time skip\" between the Marineford and Fishman Island sagas, where series ratings then dip begin another moderate climb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the mean and median positions, we can notice some observations relating to the skew distribution of episode ratings within each saga. The East Blue, Alabasta, Skypeia, Marineford, Fishman Island, Punk Hazard, and Dressrosa arcs are all relatively centered. The means and medians of these episodes are nearly equal, meaning there is a reasonable balance between \"good\" and \"bad\" episodes. There is some downwards (\"negative\"/\"left\") skewing present in the Water Seven, Thriller Bark, and Wano sagas, meaning that a number of lower-rated episodes are dragging the overall average ratings below what the typical episode rating is. The opposite is true for the Whole Cake Island saga, where a few higher rated episodes create a slight upwards (\"positive\"/\"right\") skew. Longer boxplot whiskers in the Whole Cake Island and Wano sagas highlight the significant fluctuations in episode ratings, as seen in the earlier time series chart. Earlier sagas with shorter whiskers ten to maintain more consistent ratings for each episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers above the upper whiskers are \"event\" episodes, a.k.a. the more climactic canon episodes. Outliers below the lower whiskers are low-performing episodes. Most under-performing outliers are linked to filler content, with portions of the Levely arc possibly being an exception, though this is still up for debate. The Water Seven and Thriller Bark sagas show numerous filler outliers causing the downwards skew. In particular, the Water Seven saga is tied with Wano for the highest-rated story saga if going by the *median* of episode ratings."

    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "- Overall ratings tend to remain fairly consistent throughout the series.\n",
    "  - Some specific variation depending on the story arc.\n",
    "    - The highest rated storylines include Ennies Lobby, Marineford (\"Summit War\"), Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and Wano.\n",
    "      - Many of which also include some of the longest and most developed arcs.\n",
    "      - Not necessarily \"more is better\", but proper story development can aid ratings.\n",
    "    - Fishman Island and Punk Hazard are the lowest rated storylines.\n",
    "    - Significant fluctuation in ratings during the Whole Cake Island and Wano storylines.\n",
    "  - Canon episodes tend to have higher ratings than filler episodes.\n",
    "    - By about 1.\n",
    "    - It might be suitable to stray away from filler in favor of occasional breaks.\n",
    "      - More data necessary comparing ratings of episodes before and after recent hiatus.\n",
    "  - Ratings bumps for certain climactic story moments.\n",
    "- Reviewer activity is initially very high at the start of the series before slowly declining, plateauing for the majority of the series, and recently fluctuating upwards.\n",
    "  - This means that earlier storylines have accumulated slightly more activity than more recent ones.\n",
    "    - By a significant margin, the most reviewed storylines are the first two: East Blue and Alabasta.\n",
    "  - No significant differentiation between canon and filler episodes, concerning the number of reviewer votes.\n",
    "  - No major instances of episodes with low ratings and many reviews, indicating potential outrage."
