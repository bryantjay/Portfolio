# Data Sources

I pulled this [City of Seattle Wage Data](https://data.seattle.gov/City-Administration/City-of-Seattle-Wage-Data/2khk-5ukd/about_data) from
Seattle's [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/), dated February 22, 2025.

While the data is publicly available information on civil servants, I still elected to remove names from the CSV file, as I'd rather not keep post sensitive PII on city employees.
