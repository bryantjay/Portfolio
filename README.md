Hello! My name is Bryant, and I'm a data analyst with a diverse background. I earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics from the University of Washington and hold dual bachelor's degrees in both Business Administration and Music from the University of Central Florida. My experience spans promotional marketing, nonprofit volunteer work, and customer-facing retail. I try to bring both technical skills and people-oriented insights to every project. Currently, I build and evaluate AI training data as an independent analyst, focusing on programming logic in Python, SQL, R, and spreadsheets.

## Projects

### [Twitter Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/bryantjay/Portfolio/tree/main/Twitter%20Tableau%20Dashboard)

**Tools**: R, Tableau  
**Description**: Personal Twitter data dashboard visualizing engagement and posting patterns.

- Final dashboard available on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryant.jay/viz/TwitterDashboard_16986198683330/TwitterDashboard).
- Raw data is withheld for privacy; only the dashboard and data-cleaning R script are included.

### [One Piece Plotly Analysis](https://github.com/bryantjay/Portfolio/tree/main/One%20Piece%20Plotly%20Analysis)

**Tools**: Python, `plotly`, `BeautifulSoup`, Jupyter Notebooks  
**Description**: Visual analysis of episode ratings, arcs, and reviewer engagement for the anime *One Piece*.

**Key Findings**:
- **Consistent Ratings**: Ratings remain between 7-8 out of 10 across the series, with spikes during major story arcs.
- **Canon vs. Filler**: Canon episodes tend to have higher ratings and more votes than filler episodes.
- **Reviewer Engagement**: Earlier arcs (East Blue, Alabasta) see significantly more reviewer activity than later ones.
- **Saga Trends**: Major arcs like Marineford and Dressrosa receive higher ratings, while arcs like Fishman Island and Punk Hazard are less popular.

Explore the full analysis through [interactive visualizations](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bryantjay/one-piece-plotly-analysis/#Visualizations) and in-depth charts on the repository.

### [R - Predicting Online Shopper Intention](https://github.com/bryantjay/Portfolio/tree/main/R%20-%20Predicting%20Online%20Shopper%20Intention)

**Tools**: R, `caret` library, Logistic Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods  
**Description**: Classification model comparison for predicting e-commerce user purchase intent.

**Key Findings**:
- **Page Values**: Prove to be the most important metric for dicerning purchasing intent across all models.
- **Random Forest**: Best overall performance in accuracy, F1, and precision; ideal for practical use here, despite interpretability limitations.
- **Decision Tree**: Solid alternative with competitive metrics and greater interpretability (if needed).
- **Transparency Tradeoffs**: Interpretable models like decision trees can be preferred in high-stakes environments, but more accurate black-box models are likely acceptable here.

### [Korean Bakery Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/bryantjay/Portfolio/tree/main/Korean%20Bakery%20Market%20Basket%20Analysis)

**Tools**: Python, `mlxtend` package, Apriori Algorithm, Jupyter Notebooks  
**Description**: Association rule mining to identify complementary and substitute products within a bakery selection.

**Key Findings**:
- **Bread with Jam**: Strong rule association between "plain bread" and "jam" reveals intuitive complementary relationship; potential for upselling jam to bread buyers.
- **Item Bundles & Combos**: Associations among top-selling products (e.g., angbutter and drinks) suggest potential for BOGO and cross-promotional campaigns.
- **Croissant & "Weiner"**: Unusual association suggests a potential for innovation or marketing a new ‚Äúpig in a blanket‚Äù inspired product.

- SPD and SCL (Seattle City Light) carry the highest overall cost-of-labor footprints.
- Parks & Rec employs the most people overall, while still keeping hourly expenditures under that of SCL and SPD.
