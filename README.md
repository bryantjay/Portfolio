üëã **Hello!** I'm a data analyst with a unique background in business administration, music, and applied analytics. I earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics from the University of Washington and hold dual bachelor's degrees from the University of Central Florida.

Currently, I work with **DataAnnotation** as an independent analyst, where I build and evaluate AI training data, focusing on programming logic in **Python, SQL, R**, and spreadsheets. I also assess model outputs for safety and accuracy.

My experience spans promotional marketing, nonprofit volunteer work, and customer-facing retail. I bring both technical skills and people-oriented insight to every project‚Äîsomething I aim to showcase in this portfolio.

**Tools**: R, Logistic Classification  
**Description**: Classification model comparison for predicting e-commerce user purchase intent.

**Key Findings**:
- **Random Forest**: Best overall performance in accuracy, F1, and precision; ideal for practical use despite interpretability limitations.
- **Decision Tree**: Solid alternative with strong interpretability and competitive metrics.
- **Transparency Tradeoffs**: Interpretable models like decision trees can be preferred in high-stakes environments, but black-box models are acceptable here.
