# Analyzing Twitter Data

This is my own personal data from Twitter.

For my own data security and privacy, I'm not going to be posting the actual data for purposes of replication. Instead,
this repository will only contain the final dashboard itself, and the R code used to automatically update and clean new 
data files.
